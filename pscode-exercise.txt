// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
sum / 2 = 0.0 print even

if sum divided by 2 and the remainder is zero, print EVEN.
else, if the number is not even, print ODD.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
input 5 different number.
add 5 inputed numbers together, then divide by 5 to find average of the 5 inputed numbers entered.
organize inputed numbers numerically, smallest number print minimum. largest number print maximum.
summerize the average, minimum numbers, and maximum numbers for the 5 inputed numbers.
